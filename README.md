# Covid-Building-Infections

This model calculates the reproduction rate (R0) for transmission of infectious diseases (Covid19) within an enclosed space. It assumes the prime method of transmission is an aerosol and that the aerosol is well mixed across the space, i.e. there are no local concentrations which may impact on an individuals probability for being infected.

The modelling follows the approach set out in the paper: Buonanno, G., Stabile, L., & Morawska, L. (2020).
