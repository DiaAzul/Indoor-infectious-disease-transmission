Covid19 Indoor Transmission Model
=================================

Infectious diseases are transmitted from an infectious person to a susceptible person through many mechanisms, including direct contact, exchange of fluids, respiritory droplets and formites. The Covid19 indoor transmission model considers transmission of the SARS-Cov-2 virus through respiritory droplets which have become aerosolised and spread through an indoor environment. The model makes some broad assumptions, the most important of which are:

* Covid19 can be transmitted between people in aerosolised respiritory droplets.
* Droplets are quickly transported throughout the entire indoor environment such that their is an equal concentration throughout the space.
