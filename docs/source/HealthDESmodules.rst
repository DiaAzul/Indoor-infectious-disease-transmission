HealthDES Discrete Event Simulation Toolkit
===========================================

The HealthDES framework provides a set of base class modules to model health and care processes using discrete event simulation. The framework supports the definition of people, resources that they need and activities the people engage in as they transition a network graph. The network graph defines the ordering of activities and the resources people need at each point as they traverse the care pathway.
